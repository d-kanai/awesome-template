# Frontend Native

## Linting & Formatting

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for TypeScript linting, formatting, and import organization.

- Run linting with automatic fixes: `pnpm lint`
- Run linting without applying fixes: `pnpm lint:check`
- Format files: `pnpm format`
- Check formatting without writing changes: `pnpm format:check`

All commands should be executed from the `frontend_native` directory.
